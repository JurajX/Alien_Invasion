# Alien Invasion

This repo contains a quite simple 2D game which is one of the three projects from the book (Python Crash Course)[https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse] by Eric Matthes.

To run the game simply run alien_invasion.py. You might need to tweak the speedup_scale parameter in the settings.py file.
